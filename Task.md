# Task summary - Toppan Photomasks, Inc.


*Input: Test_data.xlsx*
*Output: We need to read and make all the data suitable for automation*
 
Proposed Approach:
1.       Read the data from excel
2.       Parse excel using libraries, regular expression, etc
3.       You are free to use object-oriented concepts as well as a simple procedural approach
4.       All the data & sub-data should be accessible field wise
 
- E.g., “Part Ref” should be displayed as something like
- Part ref: PR 190444 LOT90 333 3434FDGG
- Subpart1: PR
- Subpart2: 190444
- Subpart3: LOT90
- Subpart4: 333
- Subpart5: 3434FDGG
